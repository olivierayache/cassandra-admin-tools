# cassandra-admin-tools

This project provides tools for Cassandra cluster administration. Multiple clusters are supported. Each cluster can be multi data center. The main feature is repair scheduling and monitoring. In order to work properly the tool needs to connect to each node of cluster via JMX (connection can be secured via login/password).
